## LITTLE GYAN : 

#### When Life Feels Spiraly, Just Untangle Slowly

When everything starts looping, thoughts, plans, emotions, don’t try to fix it all at once. Pause, breathe, and find one knot to loosen.

Like cleaning up a messy grid, don’t erase everything, just mark what drains you, what distracts you, and gently turn those parts to zero.

Bit by bit, the chaos fades, and what’s left is you, clearer, calmer, lighter.
