## DAY 10

P1 - Rotate Image (leetcode 48)

P2 - Merge Sorted Arrays Without ExtraSpace (It's on GFG)

solve these questions understand the concept, try it own your own.

## LITTLE GYAN : 

#### When Life Shifts, Flow With It

Sometimes everything around you turns, and you have to realign, not resist. Adjust your view, reshape your pattern, and you’ll see beauty in the rotation.

And when paths overlap, don’t force separation, blend gently, make space, and find balance within the same frame.

Grace lies not in control, but in how smoothly you turn and merge with change.
