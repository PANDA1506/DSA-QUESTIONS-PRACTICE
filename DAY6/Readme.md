## LITTLE GYAN : 

#### In life, we often chase the big wins, the maximum results, the loud achievements. But but but but sometimes,

 it’s the small steps, the quiet efforts, and the minimum actions that make all the difference. The biggest outcomes are often built on the smallest, most consistent contributions.

So don’t ignore the little things while aiming for the grand ones. The “max” gives you growth, but the “min” keeps you grounded. Together, they create the perfect balance, the true product of effort and patience.
