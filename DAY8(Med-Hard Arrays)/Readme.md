## LITTLE GYAN : 

#### In Life Rearrange. Sort. Replace. when ever you want 

Life’s not about big leaps, just finding your next step, the one that makes you feel a little more you.
Sort your time like colors, give every shade its space: study, smile, rest, repeat.
And when something feels off, don’t break yourself trying to fit it, just replace what’s wrong with what feels right. 

Balance will follow, quietly.
