## LITTLE GYAN : 

Life is all about balance.
Think of it like a seesaw. When we sit on it, maintaining balance is completely in our hands. Similarly, in life, the balance of everything—our emotions, efforts, and outcomes—is also in our control. 

When things get tough, it’s like a heavier person sitting on the other side of the seesaw. That “heavy person” represents our problems. Yet, we still try to play—we either adjust our position or apply more force to keep the seesaw steady. In both cases, what truly matters is that we keep trying.

Life works the same way. When challenges arise, we can adapt (manipulate the situation wisely) or work harder (apply more force). Either way, the goal is to keep balancing. There will always be ups and downs, but the secret is to enjoy the ride and keep playing through it.
