## LITTLE GYAN : 

#### In life just keep going. even if the book ends you can extend the story further 

Sometimes life feels like a puzzle, some moments are positive, some are negative, and some just stay neutral. But the real wisdom lies in learning to move with all of them together. Balance is where peace lives, and every challenge has its own hidden equation, you just need to find the right combination that makes it all make sense.

And another truth about life is this, moving forward isnâ€™t always about speed. Sometimes, you need to pause and see where the real value lies. The things that seem far apart might actually hold the greatest potential when looked at from the right angle. So, measure your moments wisely, stretch your limits calmly, and remember,  even if one story ends, you can always write a new chapter, in your own way, at your own pace.
